## CryptoLuck
CryptoLuck is a decentralized app(Dapp),where the backend of the app is in a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain</br>
the point of this Dapp is to make an online casino,where people register online and submit a bet,and after 24 hours the smart contract chooses a random winner.</br>

## Usage
In order to interact with the smart contract,you'll need to [install](https://metamask.io/) the metamask extension in your browser</br>
then start a server in the top level of your directory,for ex:
```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```
PS: if you want to deploy the smart contract,deploy it on the testnet(Ropsten)

and head to `0.0.0.0:8000` in your browser
## Tasks

1. Add a choosing mechanism in the smart contract
2. Update the design
3. Add a front-end mechanism to display the winners of each day along with the winning number
4. Let your imagination run wild!

## Useful Tools

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) Remix can be used to compile and deploy contracts. It can also be used to interact with an already-deployed contract
* [MyCrypto](mycrypto.com) a web app to interact with smart contracts directly

* [CryptoZombies](cryptozombies.io) An awesome and interactive coding school to learn about solidity and smart contracts.

## Things To Read

* [Program the Blockchain ](https://programtheblockchain.com/) a useful blog about smart contracts

* [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) -The Solidity documentation isn't always the best written, but it's fairly comprehensive.
